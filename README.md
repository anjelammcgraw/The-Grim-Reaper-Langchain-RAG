# 🤖 The Grim Reaper - Langchain RAG 
Midterm Certification Challenge: RAG

In this repo, you'll find a pretty entertaining RAG application, using Langchain, OpenAI, text-3-embedding small, GPT-3.5-turbo, the FAISS vectorstore, and an extra component: visibility tooling with WandB. This project was done during the middle  of AI Makerspace's AI Engineering Bootcamp Cohort 1 (AIE1).
